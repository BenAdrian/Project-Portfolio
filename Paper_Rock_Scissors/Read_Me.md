# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮

## 📌 About This Project
This project is a simple implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. I created this project as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my fundamental understanding of Python, including programming logic, input-output handling, loops, conditionals, and basic data visualization to display game results.

## 🛠️ Features
* Interactive: Players can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors and compete against the computer.
* Input Validation: The system detects invalid inputs and prompts the player to enter a valid selection.
* Game Statistics: At the end of the game, the program displays the number of wins, losses, and draws.
* Data Visualization: Uses matplotlib to generate a pie chart summarizing the game results.

## 🔗 Technologies Used
* Python (Core programming)
* Matplotlib (Game result visualization)

## 📌 Notes
This is a beginner-level project to grasp the basics of Python. In the future, I plan to improve this project by adding a graphical user interface (GUI) or an online multiplayer mode.
