# Superstore Sales Analysis Portfolio

 ## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my portfolio as a Data Analyst to demonstrate my skills in Python for data analysis. The dataset used in this project is the Superstore Sales dataset, which contains transaction records from January 2015 to December 2018. The analysis focuses on exploring Total Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) since the dataset does not include quantity and discount columns.

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset yang digunakan adalah Superstore Sales Dataset, yang berisi informasi transaksi dari sebuah toko retail. Data ini mencakup berbagai fitur seperti:
- Order Date & Ship Date: Tanggal pemesanan dan pengiriman
- Sales: Nilai penjualan per transaksi
- Category & Sub-Category: Kategori produk yang dijual
- Region & State: Lokasi pelanggan
- Segment: Segmentasi pelanggan

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Some of the analyses conducted in this project:
- Sales trends over time (Yearly & Monthly Sales)
- Sales distribution by product category
- Sales performance based on geographic regions
- Customer segmentation and its contribution to GMV

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
-	Python: The primary programming language for this analysis.
-	Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
-	Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
-	Jupyter Notebook: As the main development environment.

## 📚 Key Insights
1.	Sales Trends Over Time
-	The analysis explores monthly and yearly GMV trends to understand sales performance.
2.	Regional Sales Analysis
-	Comparison of sales performance across different regions to identify high-revenue areas.
3.	Top Product Categories
